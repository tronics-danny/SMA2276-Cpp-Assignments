PROBLEM
The problem we wish to tackle is a lack of computerized medical records in a good number of hospitals around Kenya.
BACKGROUND
Many medical institutions in Kenya rely on physical records to keep track of a patient’s medical history. This is very prevalent in rural areas and even in learning institutions. Our own JKUAT only started digitizing medical records fairly recently.
RELEVANCE
The advantages of digitized records are obvious. Some include ease of retrieval, ease of backup, better diagnoses due to having patient histories close by, and many more.
OBJECTIVES
Below are some of the objectives to be met, including features necessary to the program.
•	Consolidation – A patient’s entire history should be available at once.
•	Privacy – Only authorized personnel should have access to the records.
•	Prioritization – Important information like allergies, related symptoms from earlier in the patient’s history should be given precedence.
•	Standardization – Medical history should be displayed in the format that doctors all over are familiar with.
•	Accountability – The system should have records log function to keep track of whoever used it and whoever was responsible for a particular patient.
•	User Friendliness – The console program should be user friendly, intuitive and low effort.
•	Comprehensiveness – The program should prompt, and be able to handle, comprehensive patient data.
•	Timeliness – The program should be able to adequately deal with timelines in the data.

It should be noted that these objectives and features are not equal. Some are essential to the system while others are not quit as necessary.
